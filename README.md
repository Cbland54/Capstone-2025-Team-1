# Capstone 2025 Team 1 ‚Äì FootWorks

## üìñ About the Project
This project is part of our **SWE Capstone course at Kennesaw State University**.  
We are building **digital engagement tools** to help **FootWorks Miami**, a family-owned specialty running store, modernize its online presence and improve in-store customer conversions.  

Our React app is designed as **standalone widgets** that can be integrated into the store‚Äôs website or run independently for demonstrations.

### üéØ Goals
- Provide customers with interactive **online tools** that preview the benefits of an in-store visit.
- Encourage **appointment scheduling** with staff, using pre-filled information from the Shoe Selector.
- Deliver **educational content** to build trust and highlight FootWorks‚Äô unique expertise.
- Ensure everything works smoothly on **mobile devices**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Modules Overview

### 1. Online Shoe Selector
- Guides customers through quick questions: shoe size, terrain, running goals, feel preference, injury history, etc.
- Produces **suggested shoe categories** (e.g., Stability, Trail, Cushioned).
- Outputs structured data that can be passed to the Scheduler for appointment pre-filling.

### 2. Smart Scheduler
- Lets customers book an in-store fitting appointment.
- Uses **results from the Shoe Selector** to pre-fill staff briefing notes (size, categories, training goals).
- Provides confirmed appointment details (date, time, notes).
- Future-ready: can integrate with Google Calendar, Outlook, or FootWorks‚Äô POS system.

### 3. Educational Media
- Embeds short **videos and guides** directly on the site.
- Recommendations tailored to customer input (e.g., trail running safety, pronation education, marathon prep).
- Builds customer trust and reinforces the value of visiting FootWorks in person.
